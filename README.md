This is a project for my PhD. I convert the existing transformer model to adapt a Graph structure.
The aim of the project is to extract cause-effect pairs from sentence. 

I am sharing the built dataset as well with this project.

You need to download the BERT model to run the code.
To run the code easily, I recommend to download the following folder of BERT from my Google drive folder.

Download the above folder to keep in the same folder.
